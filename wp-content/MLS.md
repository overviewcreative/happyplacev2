Public:	Just two years young, this beautifully and thoughtfully designed home is less than a mile to Route One, 3.5 miles to downtown Lewes and 4 miles to Lewes Beach. The wide front porch spans the width of the home, perfect for a swing and seating areas. Upon entering the home, 9- foot ceilings and an open floor plan make the home spacious and inviting. The living room has built-in bookshelves and the kitchen boasts two islands. There is space for a dining table off of the kitchen and then French doors that lead you from the kitchen to the back screened porch and fenced backyard. The split-bedroom layout places the primary bedroom - with a walk-in closet, sitting area and a stunning oversized fully tiled shower - on the right side of the home. You can access the screened back porch and backyard directly from the primary bedroom. With a doggie door, your pup(s) can access the backyard as often as they please. The two guest bedrooms, one with a custom Murphy Bed, are located on the left side of the home with a shared guest bathroom (with tub) in between. The attached two car garage features an epoxy floor and the washer and dryer are neatly tucked behind double doors. You are “at the beach”, so an outdoor shower helps keep the sand and dirt out of your house. With .28 acres, you will enjoy having front, side and back yard spaces, plus a shed that sits on a concrete pad for storing lawn and garden equipment. A private stairwell, accessed via a keyless side door entrance, or from the garage, leads to the upstairs space and provides endless possibilities! 516 square feet are finished with a one bedroom layout, bathroom with shower stall, full-size washer and dryer and kitchen with a refrigerator/freezer combo. Use it as you wish and for family, friends or as a short or long term rental. The current owners have successfully rented it on the weekends from Memorial Day to Labor Day. An additional 408 square feet upstairs - located off the bedroom- is currently used for storage but has the potential to be finished. Schedule your tour, home will be active on July 16th, and get ready to say, “Honey, I’m home!!”. The upstairs efficiency and kitchenette, along with the unfinished storage space (with the potential to be finished), is booked on the following dates with Airbnb reservations: 07/18-07/20, 07/25-07/27, 08/01-08/03, 08/08 - 08/10, 08/15-08/17 & 08/29-08/31. Showings are available on Friday, but must be completed by 1pm. Showings are available on Sunday and as of 11:30am. If you are unable to see the upstairs of the property outside of these blocked dates and flexible timing on Friday morning and Sunday afternoon, please reference the listing photos and virtual tour. Your Realtor may schedule a live virtual showing outside of the blocked dates or, if you are not represented, you may contact the listing agent directly to request one.

Public:	Welcome to 13566 Owens Rd – a rare opportunity to own 17.22 versatile acres in the heart of Sussex County. Whether you're a nature lover dreaming of a private retreat or a farmer looking to restart or expand a poultry operation, this property offers boundless potential. The 3 BR, 2 BA home is set well off the road down a long lane and the property features a mix of open land, mature woodlands, and useful infrastructure. With approximately 5–6 wooded acres, 3 tillable acres, and a peaceful pond alongside the home, it’s ideal for those seeking privacy, recreation, or a homestead lifestyle. For those interested in agriculture, the farm includes two poultry houses (most recently under contract with Mountaire in 2023/2024), a manure shed, and multiple outbuildings—with room to add a third house if desired. Whether you aim to bring the poultry houses back into production or start something new, the groundwork is already in place. Being sold AS-IS – ready for your vision! Buyers and agents should conduct their own due diligence regarding potential upgrades needed for poultry contracts or other agricultural uses. Whether you envision restarting the farm or crafting your own private country escape, this property offers the space and setting to make it happen!
Directions
GPS is accurate (take Rt 13 to Hunters Cove Rd, go 0.5 miles to Owens Rd on the left, - 2 chicken houses are up front and the home is down the long lane).
