## 🔧 Development Setup (Your Local Machine)

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ (for development only)
- NPM 8+ (for development only)

## 📁 File Structure for Deployment

### **What Gets Deployed (Include in Git)**
```
happy-place-theme/
├── dist/                    ✅ Built assets (REQUIRED)
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── manifest.json
├── assets/                  ✅ Source assets
├── includes/               ✅ PHP files
├── template-parts/         ✅ Templates
├── package.json           ✅ For developers
├── vite.config.js         ✅ Build config
└── style.css              ✅ Required WP file
```

### **What Stays Local (Exclude from Git)**
```
node_modules/              ❌ Never commit (huge size)
.env                       ❌ Environment variables
*.log                      ❌ Log files

## 🌐 Environment-Specific Instructions

### **Moving to New Development Machine**
```bash
# Get the code
git clone your-repository-url
cd theme-directory

# Install dependencies for development
npm install

# You're ready to develop!
npm run dev
```

### **Deploying to Production Server**
```bash
# Method 1: Git deployment (recommended)
git clone your-repository-url
# Built assets are already there!

# Method 2: FTP upload
# Upload entire theme folder including /dist/
# No additional steps needed
```

### **Deploying to WordPress.org**
If submitting to WordPress.org theme directory:
1. Copy theme folder
2. Remove: `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `src/`, `.gitignore`
3. Keep: `dist/`, `assets/`, `includes/`, etc.
4. Built assets work without build tools

## 🔄 Asset Management Strategy

### **Our Approach: Hybrid System**
1. **Development**: Use build tools for optimization
2. **Production**: Serve pre-built assets
3. **Fallback**: Theme works without build system

### **Asset Loading Logic**
```php
// In includes/services/class-hph-assets.php
if (file_exists($dist_path . '/manifest.json')) {
    // Load optimized assets from /dist/
    $this->load_from_manifest();
} else {
    // Fallback: Load from /assets/ directly
    $this->load_from_assets();
}
```

### **Benefits**
- ✅ Fast development with hot reload
- ✅ Optimized production assets  
- ✅ Works without Node.js on server
- ✅ Easy deployment anywhere

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Assets not loading" on production**
1. Check if `/dist/` folder exists
2. Verify file permissions (755 for folders, 644 for files)
3. Check WordPress debug log for asset errors

### **"Build failing" in development**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### **"Different versions on different machines"**
- Always use `package-lock.json` (commit it)
- Run `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for exact versions

### **"Need to update theme on hosted site"**
```bash
# On your hosting account (via SSH/File Manager)
git pull origin main
# Assets are updated automatically
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Version Control Best Practice**
```bash
# Your typical workflow:
npm run build              # Build assets
git add .                 # Stage everything including /dist/
git commit -m "New feature"
git push                  # Deploy to all environments
```

### **Hosting Provider Compatibility**
- **Shared Hosting**: ✅ Works (pre-built assets)
- **VPS/Dedicated**: ✅ Works (can build locally or on server)  
- **WordPress.com**: ✅ Works (upload theme zip with /dist/)
- **WP Engine**: ✅ Works (Git integration supported)

### **Performance Benefits**
- Built CSS: ~80% smaller than source files
- Built JS: Minified and optimized
- Critical CSS: Inlined automatically
- Lazy loading: Non-critical assets deferred

**Bottom Line**: Build locally, commit assets, deploy anywhere! 🚀
