## Files Created So Far

### âœ… Completed Files:
1. **hph-framework-todo.md** - Development checklist
2. **hph-framework.css** - Main import file that brings everything together
3. **variables.css** - Enhanced CSS variables with real estate specific values
4. **listing-card.css** - Complete listing card component with variants
5. **agent-card.css** - Complete agent/team card component with variants
6. **property-gallery.css** - Gallery component with lightbox and multiple layouts
7. **hero-sections.css** - Multiple hero section variants

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority Files to Create:
Based on our todo list, the next files to create are:

1. **map-components.css** - Interactive map wrappers and styles
2. **price-displays.css** - Price formatting and display components
3. **property-features.css** - Feature grids and amenity displays
4. **virtual-tour.css** - Virtual tour embed containers
5. **open-house.css** - Open house event cards and calendars

## How to Implement

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure
```bash
cd /wp-content/themes/happy-place/assets/css/
mkdir -p framework/{base,utilities,components,real-estate,layouts,interactive,states,wordpress,responsive,print}
```

### Step 2: Place Created Files
Place each created CSS file in its corresponding directory as shown in the structure above.

### Step 3: Extract Existing Components
The original `hph-framework.css` file contains many components that need to be extracted into separate files. For example:
- Extract button styles to `components/buttons.css`
- Extract card styles to `components/cards.css`
- Extract form styles to `components/forms.css`
- etc.

### Step 4: Enqueue in WordPress
Add to your theme's `functions.php`:

```php
function hph_enqueue_framework_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style(
        'hph-framework',
        get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/css/hph-framework.css',
        array(),
        '2.0.0',
        'all'
    );
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'hph_enqueue_framework_styles');
```

### Step 5: Create Supporting JavaScript
Some components (gallery, modal, carousel) will need JavaScript for interactivity. These should be created in `/assets/js/components/`.

## Development Workflow

1. **Current Phase**: Creating real estate-specific components
2. **Next Phase**: Extract and reorganize existing utility classes
3. **Following Phase**: Create interactive components with JavaScript
4. **Final Phase**: Documentation and component playground

## Notes

- All files use pure CSS (no SCSS compilation needed for testing)
- Files follow a consistent naming convention using kebab-case
- Each component file is self-contained but relies on CSS variables from `variables.css`
- Responsive styles are included within each component file but can be extracted later
- The framework is designed to be modular - you can include only what you need
