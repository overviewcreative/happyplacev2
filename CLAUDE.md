wp db check

# Clear caches (if needed)  
wp cache flush
```

### Debugging
- Enable `HP_DEBUG` constant for detailed logging
- Check error logs for migration and service issues
- Use test suite for comprehensive system verification

## Recent Fixes 

### 1. Migration Error Resolution
**Issue**: "Migration failed: undefined" error when running database migrations.

**Root Cause**: AJAX handlers for migration weren't properly registered, causing undefined responses.

**Solution**:
1. Added AJAX handlers to Bootstrap class initialization
2. Created proper `handle_migration_ajax()` and `handle_clear_crons_ajax()` methods  
3. Integrated auto-migration into plugin initialization flow
4. Added comprehensive error handling and logging
5. Removed duplicate handlers from test file

**Files Modified**:
- `class-bootstrap.php` - Added AJAX registration and handler methods
- `test-user-system-integration.php` - Cleaned up duplicate handlers

### 2. FollowUp Boss Settings Form Error Resolution
**Issue**: "❌ Request failed. Please try again." when saving FollowUp Boss settings.

**Root Cause**: Settings registration mismatch between form submission (`hp_integrations_settings`) and registration group (`hp_followup_boss_settings`).

**Solution**:
1. Updated settings registration to use unified `hp_integrations_settings` group
2. Integrated with Configuration Manager for centralized API key management
3. Added proper sanitization callbacks for all setting types
4. Updated form fields to use Configuration Manager's unified field names

**Files Modified**:
- `class-followup-boss-integration.php` - Fixed settings registration and form integration

## Security Features

### Permission Checks
- Admin-only access to test suite and migration tools
- Nonce verification for all AJAX requests
- Capability checks (`manage_options`) for sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Automatic cleanup of old activity records (1 year retention)
- Secure handling of user preferences and search data
- No sensitive data logged in debug modes

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed columns for common queries
- Efficient JSON storage for search criteria
- Composite indexes for multi-column searches

### Caching Strategy
- User favorites cached in user_meta for backward compatibility
- Engagement scores calculated and cached
- Search results can be cached by theme/plugins

### Background Processing
- Cron jobs for search alert emails
- Asynchronous engagement analysis
- Cleanup tasks scheduled weekly

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Test Complete Integration**: Run full test suite to verify all components
2. **Configure Email Templates**: Set up search alert email designs
3. **Theme Customization**: Adjust dashboard styling to match site design
4. **FollowUp Boss Setup**: Configure CRM integration settings
5. **User Training**: Provide documentation for agents and staff
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish logging and error tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Migration fails**: Check database permissions and HP_DEBUG logs
- **Services not initializing**: Verify class autoloading in Bootstrap
- **AJAX not working**: Confirm nonce generation and handler registration
- **Favorites not saving**: Check user permissions and table existence

### Debug Steps
1. Enable HP_DEBUG constant
2. Check error logs for specific issues  
3. Use test suite to isolate problems
4. Verify database table creation
5. Test AJAX endpoints directly
