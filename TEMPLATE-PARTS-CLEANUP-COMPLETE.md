# Template Parts Cleanup - Outdated Files Removed

## Overview
Removed 5 outdated template parts that were no longer being used by the current single-listing template. These files had been superseded by consolidated functionality in the main-body.php template part.

## Files Removed

### 1. **`description.php`** ❌ REMOVED
- **Original Purpose:** Property description display
- **Why Removed:** Functionality fully integrated into `main-body.php`
- **Code Migrated:** Property description, highlights, and read-more functionality
- **Lines in main-body.php:** ~154-167 (description section)

### 2. **`details-grid.php`** ❌ REMOVED  
- **Original Purpose:** Property details in grid layout
- **Why Removed:** Details grid functionality fully integrated into `main-body.php`
- **Code Migrated:** Basic info, rooms, sizes, financial details
- **Lines in main-body.php:** ~167-425 (details grid section)

### 3. **`features.php`** ❌ REMOVED
- **Original Purpose:** Interior/exterior features and amenities
- **Why Removed:** Features functionality fully integrated into `main-body.php`  
- **Code Migrated:** Interior features, exterior features, property features
- **Lines in main-body.php:** ~425-500+ (features sections)

### 4. **`gallery-modal.php`** ❌ REMOVED
- **Original Purpose:** Photo gallery modal overlay
- **Why Removed:** Never referenced by any active template parts
- **Code Status:** Unused - gallery-tour-section.php has its own modal implementation

### 5. **`gallery-thumbs.php`** ❌ REMOVED
- **Original Purpose:** Gallery thumbnail navigation
- **Why Removed:** Never referenced by any active template parts  
- **Code Status:** Unused - gallery-tour-section.php has its own thumbnail grid

## Analysis Results
